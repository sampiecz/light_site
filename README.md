# Kasa light bulb web interface 

To allow other people in my home to control our smart lights I created an web frontend that is hosted on a raspberry pi.

If you want to do the same thing feel free to fork this and modify it for your needs. 

1.) Can turn bulbs on / off

2.) Can change bulbs color
